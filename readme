The following codes should be run in the environments and order indicated

Part 1: Simulated Real Decay Algorithm (for Python [Spyder 3.9])

The following code generates a simulated real decay, and it is based on the geometrical arguments presented in the "Geometric Arguments" pdf file:
01 vertexGenerator
02 boxGenerator
03 boxSelector

Part 2: Vertex Reconstruction Algorithm (for Matlab v. R2020a)

The following code is presented in the order in which it is used. The purpose of this algorithm is to reconstruct the simulated real vertices generated 
with the code in Part 1:
01 correctReconstructionCounts
02 comparisonLoop
